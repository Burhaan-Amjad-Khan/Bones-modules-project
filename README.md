# ðŸ¦´ Bone X-Ray Abnormality Detection

This project is a simple but powerful deep learning application to detect abnormalities in bone X-rays using a custom CNN trained on the **MURA dataset** from Stanford ML Group.

## ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Upload any bone X-ray image (jpg, jpeg, png)  
âœ… Predicts if it is **Normal** or **Abnormal**  
âœ… Runs locally or can be deployed on Streamlit Cloud, Docker, or even integrated into hospital systems via API.

## ðŸ§  Model

- A lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch.
- Trained on the MURA dataset (large dataset of musculoskeletal radiographs).
- Achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and abnormal X-rays.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python 3.9
- PyTorch for deep learning
- Streamlit for web app
- Docker for containerization
- Pillow for image handling
